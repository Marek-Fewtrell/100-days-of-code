# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: COntinued with Youtube Soundboard. Adding in error checking for the api calls.

**Thoughts**: I am finding the documentation for the api is kinda vague about the error handling part. It doesn't give a solid example. I just need to decipher it. I didn't get a lot done today otherwise, I ran out of time because I didn't do it during the day.

### Day 12: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: COntinued with Youtube Soundboard. It now searches the users Google Drive for any spreadsheets that the user can select. Additionally, can create a new spreadsheet. Created a modal screen for these operations and settings.

**Thoughts**: The Sheets API can actually create a new spreadsheet easily. Only need the Drive API to search for existing files. I will need to add error handling soon. This project has come together nicely and is really useable with a lot of features.

### Day 11: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Incorporated the Google Drive API in Youtube Soundboard. It now finds the correct file for the logged in user.

**Thoughts**: It'll search for the file named 'Youtube Soundboard' in the users drive. Will need to add more functionality later, like when the file doesn't exist. Didn't accomplish much today, went to Brisbane Lifeline Bookfest.

### Day 10: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up the Youtube Soundboard files. The code isn't as clutteredas much anymore. Some horrendous code was replaced with good code. Everything runs smoothly now.

**Thoughts**: The code was in need of some clean up to remove old debugging console logs. Other bits of code just needed to be redone properly. Will need to continue improving the code. Might even add comments to it.

### Day 9: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fully integrated Google Sheets API into the Youtube SoundBoard. All CRUD operations possible.

**Thoughts**: Took a while and a bit of effort but I have successfully added Sheets API to the project. It now acts as my backend to store data. While doing it, I found the documentation for the authorisation of Google services to be kind of confusing. The samples and guides didn't match up completely. I mgiht just need to spend some more time with it. It didn't impact my progress significantly.

### Day 8: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Youtube SOundbard and adding in the Sheets API functionality.

**Thoughts**: Will eventually get it all hooked up with the api. It's slow progress planning it out and doing small bits at a time.

**Link to work**: None.

### Day 7: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Youtube SOundbard. Started to include Google Sheets API for use as the backend.

**Thoughts**: I've already used Google Sheets API for a previous application so I have some previous knowledge.

### Day 6: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Youtube SOundbard. Added Bootstrap to the project and added some basic styling.

**Thoughts**: I Chose bootstrap because it was nice and easy to make a responsive design. This project needs to be usable on a mobile as well. It's nice to have finally styled the page into something more usable.

### Day 5: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Youtube SOundbard. Completed the search functionality. Can change pages of the search results to view more. Additionally, added the project to github.

**Thoughts**: I got stuck for a little while and added a number of console.logs to help debug. Turns out I forgot to add the pageToken variable to the search request. So it wasn't sending it to change the page.

### Day 4: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Youtube SOundbard. Started to incorporate search into it by using the Youtube Data API.

**Thoughts**: The api is really easy to use. I should style the webpage properly. That can a job for tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Youtube SOundbard. It can now save and play youtube videos

### Day 2: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a project called Youtube Soundboard. It's a proof of concept at the moment. Using the Youtube API and JQuery.

**Thoughts**: Was a bit rusty with JQuery but it is easy to pick up. The Youtube API seems to be pretty easy to use. It's looking good.

**Today's Progress**: Improved the Sudoku Helper Webpage. Improved the suggestion functionality.
