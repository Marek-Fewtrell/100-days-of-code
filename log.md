### Day 1: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved the Sudoku Helper Webpage. Improved the suggestion functionality.

**Thoughts**: I had to remember how to do some Javascript but otherwise I am happy with the result. I am happy the you are present all the numbers and any invalid numbers are greyed out.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
