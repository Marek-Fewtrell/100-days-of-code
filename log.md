### Day null: January 31th, 2017

Skipped

### Day 23: January 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added comments and documentation to Youtube Soundboard.

**Thoughts**: Comments are very important, I have a habit of being to enthusiastic about getting functionality working to stop and add some necessary comments.

**Link to work**: [Github Commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/678deb301f646697e35cb52c819aaa59e9ab415b).

### Day 22: January 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the Youtube Soundboard to an acceptable state. Basically version 1.0

**Thoughts**: It has been long progress but I am happy with the functionality and design of the project. There is much more to be done on it, but that can be done in little steps. I have made it run, now I need to make it right, then make it fast. SOme things to do with it:
Create a better mobile interface
Refactor Javascript code (make it better)
Optimise the API calls to reduce quota use

### Day null: January 28th, 2017

Climbed a mountain again. A different one this time.

### Day 21: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the error stuff again.

**Thoughts**: Improving the design of error display was a bit tedious to get to where it is now. It'll provide a nice way to view any errors.

**Link to work**: [Github Commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/074740d39172df601746ce031ed36b7ee9ccdfcd).

### Day 20: January 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Consolidated the API error handling into one function for the entire project. This only catches the errors, still need to handle them.

**Thoughts**: According to the reference documnetation for the API's being used, there are a set of global errors that occure. Additionally, there are API specific errors as well. This will be able to handle them all. 

**Link to work**: [Github Commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/0fb2275981c5052ac7db422fd77633faa723f1ca).

### Day 19: January 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved the user interface a little. Display messages/info better.

**Thoughts**: Trying to improve a user interface design is difficult. I believe I improved it. Not much else was accomplished.

**Link to work**: [Github Commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/b1e67e13995584ebd5e5b760492d4ceb72dfc6a5).

### Day 18: January 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started on some better error handling.

**Thoughts**: Started on making better error handling. When API calls fail, they call one major error handling function. So all errors are handled in the one place. We shall see how that will work out. Documentation for the API errors have been a hit and a miss. The Youtube API docs have info about global errors, but nowhere else has it. The Sheets API don't seem to have any error info at all.

### Day 17: January 23th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated the Youtube Search functionality to have pagination and stopped making unecessary requests.

**Thoughts**: I used work from my previous commit to complete this. Didn't do much today otherwise.

**Link to work**: [Github Commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/10296effec3c419c5e691ca6101c2faa8acaddc2).

### Day 16: January 22th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finalised the file search functionality for Youtube Soundboard.

**Thoughts**: It took some thinking to work out how to properly handle dynamically loading pages of results on demand. It's a first try so it's horrible but I'm glad I could get it working.

**Link to work**: [Github Commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/796bdb93bc77fe6d22a9108d804de71a3deff49a).

### Day 15: January 21th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All API calls should have basic error handling stuff.

**Thoughts**: At the moment, the error handling has simply been copy and pasted. This is just to get it all working properly. Once I know what each error needs to do I can hopefully refactor it down into a function.

**Link to work**: [Github Commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/affc3b3647aa45fe3c0526efa1cac01cb34a3279).

### Day 14: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued adding error handling to the API calls.

**Thoughts**: It has been kinda difficult working out the error handling for the API calls. But I think I understand it all properly now. Had trouble with the authorisation api stuff, but I moved onto the first api call used, the Drive API. It is straightforward to add the handling now.

**Link to work**: [Github Commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/0cece713c92aef6263968702dec4b6ef8d817f59).

### Day 13: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: COntinued with Youtube Soundboard. Adding in error checking for the api calls.

**Thoughts**: I am finding the documentation for the api is kinda vague about the error handling part. It doesn't give a solid example. I just need to decipher it. I didn't get a lot done today otherwise, I ran out of time because I didn't do it during the day.

### Day 12: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: COntinued with Youtube Soundboard. It now searches the users Google Drive for any spreadsheets that the user can select. Additionally, can create a new spreadsheet. Created a modal screen for these operations and settings.

**Thoughts**: The Sheets API can actually create a new spreadsheet easily. Only need the Drive API to search for existing files. I will need to add error handling soon. This project has come together nicely and is really useable with a lot of features.

**Link to work**: [Github commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/3d1e5b94afb796af59069865333727d6d55bdde1).

### Day 11: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Incorporated the Google Drive API in Youtube Soundboard. It now finds the correct file for the logged in user.

**Thoughts**: It'll search for the file named 'Youtube Soundboard' in the users drive. Will need to add more functionality later, like when the file doesn't exist. Didn't accomplish much today, went to Brisbane Lifeline Bookfest.

**Link to work**: [Github commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/fd07898088ab717fbe01658c50efaaa14dc9c89b).

### Day 10: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up the Youtube Soundboard files. The code isn't as clutteredas much anymore. Some horrendous code was replaced with good code. Everything runs smoothly now.

**Thoughts**: The code was in need of some clean up to remove old debugging console logs. Other bits of code just needed to be redone properly. Will need to continue improving the code. Might even add comments to it.

**Link to work**: [Github commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/5e961cbbd66e16600d5512cb06f7df8ea5138143).

### Day 9: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fully integrated Google Sheets API into the Youtube SoundBoard. All CRUD operations possible.

**Thoughts**: Took a while and a bit of effort but I have successfully added Sheets API to the project. It now acts as my backend to store data. While doing it, I found the documentation for the authorisation of Google services to be kind of confusing. The samples and guides didn't match up completely. I mgiht just need to spend some more time with it. It didn't impact my progress significantly.

**Link to work**: [Github commit](https://github.com/Marek-Fewtrell/Youtube-Soundboard/commit/008513fb07ba167bf7dcf08f8c3f398115708013).

### Day 8: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Youtube SOundbard and adding in the Sheets API functionality.

**Thoughts**: Will eventually get it all hooked up with the api. It's slow progress planning it out and doing small bits at a time.

**Link to work**: None.

### Day 7: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Youtube SOundbard. Started to include Google Sheets API for use as the backend.

**Thoughts**: I've already used Google Sheets API for a previous application so I have some previous knowledge.

### Day 6: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Youtube SOundbard. Added Bootstrap to the project and added some basic styling.

**Thoughts**: I Chose bootstrap because it was nice and easy to make a responsive design. This project needs to be usable on a mobile as well. It's nice to have finally styled the page into something more usable.

### Day 5: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Youtube SOundbard. Completed the search functionality. Can change pages of the search results to view more. Additionally, added the project to github.

**Thoughts**: I got stuck for a little while and added a number of console.logs to help debug. Turns out I forgot to add the pageToken variable to the search request. So it wasn't sending it to change the page.

### Day 4: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Youtube SOundbard. Started to incorporate search into it by using the Youtube Data API.

**Thoughts**: The api is really easy to use. I should style the webpage properly. That can a job for tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Youtube SOundbard. It can now save and play youtube videos

**Thoughts**: Getting all the basics working is a bit tedious but I got through it. I believe I got everything there.

### Day 2: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a project called Youtube Soundboard. It's a proof of concept at the moment. Using the Youtube API and JQuery.

**Thoughts**: Was a bit rusty with JQuery but it is easy to pick up. The Youtube API seems to be pretty easy to use. It's looking good.

### Day null: January 7th, 2017

Skipped. Climbed a mountain.

### Day 1: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved the Sudoku Helper Webpage. Improved the suggestion functionality.

**Thoughts**: I had to remember how to do some Javascript but otherwise I am happy with the result. I am happy the you are present all the numbers and any invalid numbers are greyed out.
